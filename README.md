# Elytra Bounce
This is a small plugin that, when toggled with a command, disables landing while gliding with an elytra, thereby allowing the 
player to 'bounce' and gain altitude, speed, and momentum. It was designed with ordinary survival in mind, meaning that dying 
or unequipping an elytra will work as in vanilla Minecraft. Additionally, players with elytra bouncing enabled can temporarily 
disable bouncing by pressing SHIFT, allowing them to land. Upon landing, elytra bouncing will be re-enabled.

### Permissions:
- elytrabounce.bounce | Gives the player permission to enable or disable personal elytra bouncing
- elytrabounce.bounceothers | Gives the player permission to manually enable or disable elytra bouncing for other players.

### Commands:
- /bounce | (OR /eb) Enables or disables elytra bouncing for a player. Can be used alone or with arguments (@a, @p, @s, @r, [username]).

### Important Notes:
- Players who have had their elytra bouncing manually enabled will not be able to disable it without the "elytrabounce.bounce" permission.
- This plugin will allow players equipped with an elytra to enter one-block spaces with greater ease.
